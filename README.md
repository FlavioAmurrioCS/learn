To start with some python you can start here under "Learn The Basics". It has inline code block that you modify and run.
https://www.learnpython.org/ you can also try https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3

Once you have gone thru the examples above, you should create an account on github https://github.com/ . Github is a website where people can post their code to share with other people. Most people post their porfolios here. This will also allow you to run codespaces for the following section.

Next you should learn Visual Studio Code. VSCode is a text editor with support for extensions/plugins that can support almost all programing languages out there. Since you dont have a laptop for now, you can try using their online editor names codespaces(it basically creates a virtual machine that you can connect to and run code). I create a project where you can get started. Do some of the examples first section here.

It is also good to learn the terminal/shell. The terminal is a way to interact with programs on your machine via text commands. You will need this knowledge as you build more complex projects and work more efficiently
